Hi, I’m @kaleub
I’m a Georgia native, but through the course of life have found myself embracing the mountain west, as many have. There is a sense of adventure here; it is the wild west, after all. I am a systematic organizer of information, a visual problem solver, and an idealistic perfectionist who seeks to build functional end-products. I embrace challenges both inside and outside of design, enjoying collaborative spaces where I can learn new skills while still contributing to the team. I currently live, work, and play in the greater Provo, Utah area. Here, I work as a digital designer and project manager. After hours find me outside, I fancy myself to be a bit of an adventurer. Trail running, Mountain Biking, Motorcycling, and Hiking are the most popular among many activities I appreciate.
